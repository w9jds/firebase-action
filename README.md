# GitHub Actions for Firebase

This Action for [firebase-tools](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) enables arbitrary actions with the `firebase` command-line client.

## Inputs

* `args` - **Required**. This is the arguments you want to use for the `firebase` cli


## Environment variables

* `FIREBASE_TOKEN` - **Required if GCP_SA_KEY is not set**. The token to use for authentication. This token can be aquired through the `firebase login:ci` command.

* `GCP_SA_KEY` - **Required if FIREBASE_TOKEN is not set**. A base64 encoded private key (json format) for a Service Account with the `Firebase Admin` role in the project, and if your deploying functions you would also need the `Cloud Functions Developer` role. 
And since the deploy service account is using the App Engine default service account in the deploy process, it also 
needs the `Service Account User` role.
If your only doing Hosting `Firebase Hosting Admin` is enough.

* `PROJECT_ID` - **Optional**. To specify a specific project to use for all commands, not required if you specify a project in your `.firebaserc` file.

* `PROJECT_PATH` - **Optional**. The path to `firebase.json` if it doesn't exist at the root of your repository. e.g. `./my-app`

## Example

To authenticate with Firebase, and deploy to Firebase Hosting:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build-prod
      - name: Archive Production Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@master
        with:
          name: dist
          path: dist
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Download Artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@master
        with:
          name: dist
          path: dist
      - name: Deploy to Firebase
        uses: w9jds/firebase-action@master
        with:
          args: deploy --only hosting
        env:
          FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
```
Alternatively:

```yaml
        env:
          GCP_SA_KEY: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
```


If you have multiple hosting environments you can specify which one in the args line. 
e.g. `args: deploy --only hosting:[environment name]`

If you want to add a message to a deployment (e.g. the Git commit message) you need to take extra care and escape the quotes or the YAML breaks.

```yaml
        with:
          args: deploy --message \"${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}\"
```

### Recommendation

If you decide to do seperate jobs for build and deployment (which is probably advisable), then make sure to clone your repo as the Firebase-cli requires the firebase repo to deploy (specifically the `firebase.json`)
